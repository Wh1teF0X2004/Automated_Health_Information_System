# Automated Health Information System
The global pandemic has sped up the use of health information systems by general practitioners worldwide. However, there is still a significant obstacle that prevents the complete utilization of a health information system, which is the slow process of entering data. The problem of slow data entry impacts doctors while recording patient symptoms and diagnosis, as well as patients during the registration process. This project's goal is to expand on prior efforts to create an Automated Health Information System (AHIS) utilizing AI technologies like Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) to support daily operations.

  </a>
</p>

The MEAN stack is a popular web development framework that combines four key technologies:
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
- Express.js: A backend framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic.
- Angular: A frontend framework for creating dynamic web applications.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting.
Together, these four key technologies enable full-stack web application development.
